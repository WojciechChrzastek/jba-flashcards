## About the project

The project is designed by [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) and realised as a part of [Java Developer track](https://hyperskill.org/onboarding) using [EduTools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools) plugin for [IDEA InteliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Simulation of a question-answer game. The question-answer pairs are stored in Card objects. User can solve the quiz by giving the right answers to the questions displayed in the console. There is a possibility to add new cards as well as import and export them to files. User has also an option to print out "hardest cards", which is based on the statistics stored in a collection. If the program was started with the appropriate argument passed in the CLI, it can automatically import cards from file and after closing - export them to file with corresponding statistics.

[Detailed description](https://hyperskill.org/projects/44) of the project is available on JetBrains Academy website.

### Realisation of the project was divided into 7 stages:
- Stage #1. Displaying question-answer "cards" on the console.
- Stage #2. Verifying questions with answers provided by the user input.
- Stage #3. Developing the program logic: loops, arrays, Card object.
- Stage #4. Implementing Map interface to use key-value pairs.
- Stage #5. Importing "cards" from and exporting them to .txt files. Creating user menus.
- Stage #6. Displaying statistics about cards and saving them to .txt files.
- Stage #7. Running program methods by arguments passed in the CLI at application startup.

### Main topics covered by this project
- reading and writing files
- Collection and Map interfaces
